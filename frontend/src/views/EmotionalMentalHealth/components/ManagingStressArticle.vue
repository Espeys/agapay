        Ground yourself
      </span>
      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        When thoughts and feelings become overwhelming, an exercise called
        “grounding” can help. Start by noticing your thoughts and feelings. Slow
        down and concentrate on your body. Slowly push your feet into the floor.
        Stretch. Slow your breathing, and focus on the breath going in and out.
        If thoughts start to distract you, refocus on your breathing. Give it
        your full attention.

        Unhook from difficult thoughts
      </span>
      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        Difficult thoughts or feelings can make it hard to focus on what’s
        important. When this happens, start by noticing that a thought or
        feeling has hooked you. Then try to name it. For example, you can say,
        “I notice feelings of anger.” Once you’ve noticed and named the thought
        or feeling, refocus: pay full attention to whoever is with you and
        whatever you’re doing.

        Act on your values
      </span>
      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        Your values describe what kind of person you want to be. For example,
        some common values are “To be kind” and “To be patient.” Aim to start
        each day by thinking of 2 or 3 values you want to live by. Then use your
        actions to live by these values. Do whatever you can, no matter how
        small it might be, to act on your values.

        Be kind to yourself and others
      </span>
      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        Many of us aren’t kind to ourselves when we’re in difficult situations.
        If you’re kind to yourself you’ll have more energy to help others, so
        everyone benefits. Try speaking to yourself kindly. Think about small
        acts of kindness that you could do when you see someone in pain,
        suffering, or struggling.

        Make room for your thoughts
      </span>
      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        No matter how severe the weather, the sky has room for it, and sooner or
        later, the weather always changes. We can learn to be like the sky, and
        make room for the “bad weather” of our difficult thoughts and feelings
        without being hurt by them. Notice and name the thoughts and feelings.
        Breathe slowly and allow the feelings to be there. When you make room,
        the thoughts are still with you, but you can engage with the world
        around you.
